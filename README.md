This project presents the design and implementation of a College Event Management System, a web-based application developed to streamline and digitalize the process of organizing, managing, and participating in college events. The system allows administrators to create and manage events, while enabling students to register and receive real-time updates. Key features include user authentication, event categorization, dynamic scheduling, and notifications. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the system ensures an intuitive user interface and secure data handling. This solution significantly reduces manual workloads and enhances the overall efficiency of event coordination within educational institutions.
